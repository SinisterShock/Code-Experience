# Module 2 Spring 2022 Notes

- The most recent (as of 5/4/22) test driver is TestPlotDriver.py
- /mathplotlib/ is a directroy of experimental and example code testing and evaluating
the mathplotlib library.
- /plotly-exp/ is a directory of experimental and example code testing and evaluating the plotly library.
- map.html is a file generated by the CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) that is rendered inside a tkinter window.
- All other files are either used by the test driver, are old test files, or are things that we thought we needed but didn't.
