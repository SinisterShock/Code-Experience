### Sumarry
I organized the files into a MVVM design structure for the following
- SunriseSunset
- Add City
- Main Page
- Current Weather
- 5 Day Forcast

These files then used the Binding method to display each section's desired api call from either an Observable Collection or using the OnPropertyChanged
