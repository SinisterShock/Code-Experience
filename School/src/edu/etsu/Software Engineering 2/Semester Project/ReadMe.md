# CSCI-4350 Software Engineering Semester Project
This was a project focused on learning and performing the processes of SCRUM with our formed teams. Over the course of the 2024 Spring semester we worked together across five 2-week sprints to build a more robust version of the previous semester's "BucStop" application.

Our main focus over our sprints consisted of:
* Deploying the BucStop application and monolithic microservice to my private server.
* Automated deployment using Jenkins and Groovy Pipeline scripts.
* Deploying a test environment to AWS
* Creating unit and regression tests utilizing Selenium
* Rebuilding the orginal architecture to use an API Gateway and seperate microservices for each game.
