# **Tyler Burleson's Coding experience**
## This is a list of all my code I currently have since I started my education in 2020

# Contents
- Java
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- MYSQL (Remnants of old assignments unfortunately lost)

# Summary
This is a living collection that will constantly grow as I continue my education and work experience. 
I still have 5 mobile applications working with C# and Xamrin using API's that may be asked for due to complications pushing them up to Github.
